Week 7: 26 Feb - 4 March

### What did you do this past week?

Last week I spent most of my time studying for the test so we didn't spend too much time on the project. 

### What's in your way?

This week is going to be tough. I am worried that the number of times we have to meet before the due date is limited. With spring break coming up I don't think that we have as much work time as it s

### What will you do next week?

Next week our team will meet to both study for the test and work on the project. We have done a little planning but there is much to be done still. We will create a data base using PostgreSQL. We need to extend the carousel so that it is full screen, I have used Mocha as a react testing framework before. I am sure that my past experience will come in handy.

### What's my experience of the class?

We will be having the first test this week so I will get a sense of how I am doing so far in the class. After the test is graded I will have a much better picture of what the class is like. The second phase of the project looks like it will require more work than the first part so I am interested in how I will feel about the class after the second phase is complete.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
