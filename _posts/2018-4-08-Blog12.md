### What did you do this past week?

This we worked on the final stage of our project. We have had to fix some stuff from the last phase because we introduced some minor bugs. I'm excited that we finally have time to really improve our projects UI. We have been looking into refining the way that we present the data for each individual data member.

### What's in your way?

There isn't much in our way as a group but I do have alot of work from my other classes. I am confident that we will be able to finish the project in plenty of time. I am hoping that this time we don't have to stress so much at the end of the project. I have been working on leaning css 

### What will you do next week?

Next week we will be working on finishing up our project. We have some design improvments in mind. We are thinking about upgrading our offered searching function and we are working on better integrating out linking functionality between the pages. We are also looking into upgarding the way we have integrated out social media links and how we present the data. 

### What's my experience of the class?

The work we have been doing with refactoring has been really interesting. I have never taken a class where we have talked about code design like this. I will have to do some more research on the "right" way to do things. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My tip of the week this week is to checkout this git tutorial it is great for working in teams and handling git problems. I have been referencing it over the course of the project and it has saved me a bunch of time. I would recoment practicing resolving git merge conflicts so when it happens in your project you can minimize the risk of losing work.
