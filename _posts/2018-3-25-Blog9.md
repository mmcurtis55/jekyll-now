Week 10: 26 Mar - 1 April

### What did you do this past week?

This week we were a lot less focused on the project than last week.I guess we had to do our other class work some time. We were able to meet and start planning for the next phase. I worked with my iOS project group to get the Beta version of our project ready. We are not quite done yet but I have been pretty happy with our progress sofar. 

### What's in your way?

There isn't much in our way, at least that is how it feels now. We have been chugging along on the project so I'm not worried about finishing this phase. Unfortunatly right now I am receving a webpack error that I don't quite know how to fix. When I simply import "pg", a node module that allows me to access our data base, I get a Can't find  Module "." error. 

### What will you do next week?

Next week we have to finish up phase 3 of the project. We still need to implement pagination. I think this will be a tough part of the project. I also have a test and a project due for other classes next week so I is going to be a busy week for me. 

### What's my experience of the class?

When we started learing python and SQL I though that I knew them pretty well but I have learned a lot from the in class lectures. It was suggested in class that I should refresh my SQL knolage by going through a Quizlet flash card deck. I have found this to be a pretty good way of studying. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My pick of the week this week is to checkout one of the State parks around Texas. I have gone camping and hiking in a few of them over the years and I have not been disapoined yet. It is always fun to hangout with friends on an outdoor adventure. 
I have been to :
  Fort Boggy State Park
  McKinney Falls State Park
  Bastrop State Park
