### What did you do this past week?

This week we worked for days on phase 3 of the project. We meet for hours every day this week so that we could get it done on time. It was tough to get it done but we were able to get it done and turned in before the deadline. This week I also had a test in my German class and a project due for my iOS class which made this week grueling. 

### What's in your way?

Im not quite sure what will be in our way next week other than the semester coming to a close and with it a bunch of assignments from all of our classes. I did have a hard time with the Hacker Rank question from Friday so I will have to keep studying and reviewing the Hacker Rank stuff before the test. 

### What will you do next week?

Next week we will begin working on phase 4 of the IMDB project. I haven't read the project description yet but I know that we need to do some UI improvements before we turn in the final version. 

### What's my experience of the class?

I have been blown away by how much different stuff is required to learn to complete the projects. For me the projects have taken huge amounts of time and effort. I would not recommend taking this class with other though or project based classes unless you know some web dev already. I have noticed that groups with 6 people are farther along on the project and more prepared on presentation day than groups with 5 people but Im sure that there are many factors that go into that. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Im running out of things to recommend but I love the TV show Brooklyn Nine-Nine. I have not been able watch much of this season because I have been so busy but I loved the last few seasons. I have been a fan of Andy Sandberg since his days on SNL and it is great to see him finally star in his own show.
