### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My tip-of-the-week this week is to look into where you are getting your news. After the 2016 fake news debacle it is more important than ever to not only be infomred but audit the infromation you are taking in. Ideally people should double check or tripple check their news outlets but noone has enough time to do that with every peice of information they recieve. So to find a middle ground you should at least look into how realiable your primary news source is. I also suggest pulling from two "opposing" news outlets to escape the [echo chamber effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)).
