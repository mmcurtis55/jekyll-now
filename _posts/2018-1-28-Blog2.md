### What did you do this past week?

This past week I started working on the Collatz project. It has been a busy week with all my classes starting up. I am taking German and iOS programming along with SWE. I think that this semester is going to be a great last semester. I hope that SWE and iOS don't have overlaping due dates. That would make things tough. I want to make sure that I put my all into the website because I can put it on my resume it. 

### What's in your way?

The only thing in my way right now is I don't know how to make the collatz project fast enough to pass the last 2 Hacker rank tests. I'm sure that I will figure it out before it is due next week. I am still waiting on the refactoring text to arrive but it should be here well before it is needed. 

### What will you do next week?

Next week I will finish the collatz project and do the readings. I will have to look at the schedule to see if the readings are in the book or some other page. I also have to start working on a German presentation and I have an iOS project due next friday. All in all though I am not too worried about being able to finish. I think that the first few weeks will be fine.

### What's my experience of the class?

I'm excited to start the class. From what I have heard there is alot of learing that I have to do. I've never done any web developent before so this should give me the change to add something new to my resume. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I wanted to start my tip-of-the-week with a fun one, so I decided to choose Futurama! I have watched the show for years and have really enjoyed it. The show has been around since 1999 and I haven't watched many other shows that I have liked better.
