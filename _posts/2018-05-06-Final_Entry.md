### What did you like the most about the class?
Unlike most other classes I have taken at UT, Software Engeneering felt most like a real project. I got to work with a team on a project week after week, adding new features, refactoring code, and finally presenting our finished product to an audiendce. There aren't many other classes I have taken where the work for the class feels like it could directly translate to the professional coding world. 

### What did you like the least about the class?
One of the things I liked least about the class wasn't something about the class material but rather a scheduling thing. We had to present our website to another group a day before the due date. Ideally this would be a time to have another set of eyes on the project so we could fix any errors we didn't know about or to make improvments we hadn't thought of. Unfortunatly for one reason or another we never had a working version or our website running on the server to show the other group. I know that this is poor planning on the part of my group but I think that this could be resolved by moving the presentation date to the Friday after the due date. 

### What's the most significant thing you learned?
I learned so much in this class it is hard to choose just one. I knew nothing about web dev or servers before taking SWE and now I feel confident I could setup, write, and serve my own website. 

### How many hours a week did you spend coding for this class?
I spend about 10-17 hrs per week on the project. I had no prior knowlage so that number might be lower for people with more experence. 
### How many hours a week did you spend reading for this class?
I spent about 25 or 35 mins reading per week.
### How many lines of code do you think you wrote?
I have no idea. 2000? 

### What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
Slack is the best. I love it now. 

### What's the most useful Web dev tool that your group used that was not required?
We used used flask and react-bootstrap. Those together made things easier. 

### If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?
I would move presentation day to the friday after the due date.
