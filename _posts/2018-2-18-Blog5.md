### What did you do this past week?

I finished and turned in the first part of the IDB project. I worked together with my group to create a server, write html pages and complete the required documentation. I also began working on my semester project or my iOS class. 

### What's in your way?

The only thing in my way right now is my iOS class project has similar deadlines to this project. I hope that through careful time management I can create two great projects. But I'm worried that I will have to make tough decisions down the road. I need to get together with my group to start working on the second phase of the project as soon a possible. I'm sure there will be other things in my way when I start working but I'm not sure what they will be yet.  

### What will you do next week?

Next week my group will begin the planning stage of Phase 2. This will include, assigning a leader, writing user stories, fixing any bugs/errors in the first phase of the project, and updating our Gitbook.

### What's my experience of the class?

The first part of project 1 wasn't difficult from a technical perspective but there was a bit of a leaning curve when it came to working together as a group. I think that being about to work together in a group of programmers will be an invaluable skill when I enter the workforce so I am grateful that I can begin to learn how while still in school. I think that leaning these kinds of "soft skills" is an extremely valuable part of this class.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My tip this week is for people who enjoy coffee. I recently "discovered" nitrogen infused cold brew coffee and it is now my goto if I see it on the menu at a coffee shop. I have loved coffee for many years but I like my coffee black. I enjoyed the unique flavor and creaminess of nitor-infused coffee.
