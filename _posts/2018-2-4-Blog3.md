### What did you do this past week?

This week I finished up the collatz project. I also I stated working on my iOS assignment. I had to join a group, come up with an app idea and start maping out what a semester long project would look like. I hope that we aren't over or under shooting what is possible durring a semester. I am looking forward to writing iOS code again. It has been a few years because my old mac broke and I didn't have the funds for a new one. I am also getting acclimated to my german class. It has been a while since I had daily online assignments so I have been having a tough time remembering to do them. I set a reminder on my phone so I hope that will help me remember. 

### What's in your way?

Not much in my way right now that i know of but im sure that there will be alot in my way as soon as I start the next project. I am a little worried that the schedules for my iOS class and this class will overlap but I should be able to handle it. 

### What will you do next week?

I don't have much next week for this class but in my other classes I have alot. I guess it is lucky because then I might not have as much when i start the project for this class. 

### What's my experience of the class?

I can't really say much about how the class it because we haven't started the hard parts yet but so far I have enjoyed it. I think that the projects should be a fun learning experence. 

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My tip-of-the-week is to checkout the reddit client app Apollo! I have been "redditing" since high school and once I switched over to the Apollo for reddit I haven't looked back. It has features that other apps don't have and it is native for iOS which makes it super fast and fit the screen perfectly. It also has no ads which makes the reddit experence slightly better than the website.
